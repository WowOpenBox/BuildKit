# BuildKit
Dependencies to build [WOB/OBM](https://github.com/WowOpenBox/WowOpenBox#wowopenbox) binaries, ie a single binary with Tcl/Tk+TWAPI+misc dependencies

[OpenMultiBoxing_RR](OpenMultiBoxing_RR/) is a small program to start OpenMultiBoxing.exe as a child program in debug mode (which allows that child to set window focus)

Note that the license of each component is their own

Manually added our ico to runtime.exe as sdx seems unable to otherwise replace them all

We also unwrap and rewrapped runtime.exe to mt.exe add the app.manifest for high DPI settings
